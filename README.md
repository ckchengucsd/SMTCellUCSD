_SMTCell_ is a Cell Layout Generation Toolkit for DTCO/STCO Exploration from VLSI Lab in University of California San Diego. Our goal is to enable technology exploration on FinFET, VFET and CFET with intuitive design rule encoding using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Unlike our previous work, _SMTCell_ is equipped with flexibility in [**Gear Ratio (GR)**](https://github.com/ckchengucsd/SMTCellUCSD/blob/main/doc/AGR_Design.md), where metal pitch distance can be fully customized. We also provide functionaility to accelerate your design turnaround time with **pre-partitioning**. 
Accompnany publications can be found [Gear-Ratio-Aware Standard Cell Layout Framework
for DTCO Exploration](https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/402/c402.pdf).

_SMTCell_ currently is built around FinFET Technology. The multi-height version is availble at [SMTCellUCSD-MH](https://github.com/ckchengucsd/SMTCellUCSD-MH).

## Main Flow
<p align="center">
    <img src="/doc/figure/flow.png" width="650">
</p>

To run our codebase, we need a customized data file called _.pinlayout_ that is converted from _.cdl_. This file comprised of basic cell design entities like pins, instances and nets. Additionally, you need to configure your own design by using _config.json_ files. To understand what each parameter is doing, please refer to documents under [HERE](https://github.com/ckchengucsd/SMTCellUCSD/tree/main/doc).

We use a SMT solver to generate a solution for the given design. The solution is then converted to a _.gdt_ file, which can be viewed using [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/). The _.gdt_ file can be converted to _.gds_ file using [GDT2GDS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gds2/).

## Setup Guide
### Quick Setup Guide
With [CMake(>3.18.0)](https://cmake.org/download/), you can easily compile our codebase. Please follow the steps below:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make # you should genSMTInputAGR and convSMTResult executables
cd ..
```
Our underlying SMT solver is [Z3 Prover Version 4.8.5](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases/tag/Z3-4.8.5). Please follow the link, download and install the software. Alternatively, if you have Python installed, we recommend you to use `pip` for easy install. 
*(Version 4.8.5 is highly recommended. Installing any other version of Z3 Prover may cause unexpected behavior.)*
```bash
# [optinal] create a Python virtual environment using venv
python3 -m venv smtcell
# [optinal] activate the virtual environment
source smtcell/bin/activate
# install z3-solver using pip
pip install z3-solver
# sanity check
z3 --version # this should return Z3 version 4.8.5 - 64 bit
```
Now you are ready to go! Optionally, please consider installing the following tools and libraries for better experience.

### Optional Tools and Libraries (Recommended)
_SMTCell_ depends on open source tools and libraries. Please download and install the following software if you want to enjoy the complete functionality of _SMTCell_.
- [GDT2GDS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gds2/) for converting .gdt to .gds.
- [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/) for viewing .gds/.lef files.
- [PROBE3.0](https://github.com/ABKGroup/PROBE3.0/) for custom PDK generation.

## Quick Start
_SMTCell_ contains three different flows. For generating
```bash
# inside the main directory
make SMTCell
# or Prepartition + main flow
make SMTCell_prepartition
# generate .gds/.lef and preview cells using Klayout
make viewSMTCell
```
## Design Your Own Cell
For setting up the cell configuration and customize cell based on your own designs, please visit this documentation [here](https://github.com/ckchengucsd/SMTCellUCSD/blob/main/doc/Design.md).

## Pre-Partitioning
<p align="center">
    <img src="/doc/figure/prepartition.png" width="650">
</p>

While smaller cell designs (e.g. AND, INV, ...) can be quickly generated within minutes of runtime, larger cells like DFF can be siginificantly slower. This is due to the fact that with larger design space, the literal, clauses and formulas grow exponentially. To combat this problem, we provide options to reduce the solution space by using prepartition engine. More documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ckchengucsd/SMTCellUCSD/blob/agr/doc/PrePartition.md).
